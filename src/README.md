# NACH Payment System – Kubernetes CI/CD Infrastructure

## Overview

This project simulates a production-style NACH payment processing platform deployed on OpenShift using modern DevOps practices.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate end-to-end CI/CD implementation using Tekton, Helm, Harness, Artifactory, and OpenShift while deploying a Spring Boot application.

## CI Pipeline (Tekton)

The Tekton pipeline performs:

1. Clone source code from GitHub
2. Build container image using Buildah
3. Tag image
4. Push image to JFrog Artifactory

Pipeline parameters:

- git-url
- git-revision
- image-repository
- image-tag

---

## CD Pipeline (Harness)

Harness is used for deployment orchestration.

Deployment flow:

1. Pull image from Artifactory
2. Deploy Helm release
3. Apply environment-specific values
4. Deploy to OpenShift
5. Verify application health

---

## Helm Features

The Helm chart includes:

- Deployment
- Service
- OpenShift Route
- Rolling Update Strategy
- Readiness Probe
- Liveness Probe
- Environment Variables
- Resource Limits
- Environment-specific Values Files

Environments:

- Development
- UAT
- Production

---

## OpenShift Configuration

The project includes:

- Namespace Management
- Service Accounts
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

These resources provide deployment permissions required by CI/CD tooling.

---

## Application

A lightweight Spring Boot application is included to demonstrate:

- Containerization
- Automated image creation
- Kubernetes deployment
- OpenShift routing

The application is intentionally minimal to keep the focus on infrastructure and CI/CD implementation.

---

## Future Enhancements

- SonarQube Integration
- Trivy Security Scanning
- Prometheus Monitoring
- Grafana Dashboards
- Automated Rollbacks
- Multi-Cluster Deployment
- GitOps Integration
